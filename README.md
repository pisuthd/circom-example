# Circom Example

This repository contains example circuits written in the Circom language. The examples utilize `circomlibjs`, `circom_tester` and `snarkjs` libraries to demonstrate the implementation of zk-SNARK without requiring a trusted setup and installing the full `circom` binary.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started 

- Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/pisuthd/circom-example`
- Install the required dependencies `npm install`
- Run all examples `npm test`


## Acknowledgements
Learning ZK-proof can be challenging, especially for developers without prior experience with zero-knowledge background. Starting with a simple JavaScript project can be handy, and I will continue to add more examples

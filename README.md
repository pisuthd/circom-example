# Circom Example

This repository contains example circuits written in the Circom language. The examples utilize `circomlibjs`, `circom_tester` and `snarkjs` libraries to demonstrate the implementation of zk-SNARK without requiring a trusted setup and installing the full `circom` binary.

## Getting Started



## Acknowledgements
Learning ZK-proof can be challenging, especially for developers without prior experience with zero-knowledge background. Starting with a simple JavaScript project can be handy, and I will continue to add more examples
